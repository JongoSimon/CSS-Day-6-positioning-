        <strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
        Absolute positioning places an element relative to
         its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a
          `position` value other than `static`). In this example,
           the child <div,> is absolutely positioned and placed 30px 
            from the top and 50px from the left of the container.
             This works because the container has `position: relative;
             , which establishes the positioning context for the child. 
             If the container did not have a `position` value other than `static`,
              the child would be positioned relative to the viewport instead.
